For Comprehensive Assignment Part 2 - Golang:

I have included 3 Go files named as the following:

1. HungarianAlgorithm.go- In directory Hungarian
2. MatchingCost.go- In directory MatchingCost
3. face_tracker.go - Main program

Program will save 1 csv file:

1.tracker_go_n.csv

NOTE: I have implemented the program to input
path to both frames 1 and 2, instead of inputting
matching cost csv file directly. I have messaged
Professor Lang about this and he has stated that
it is okay with him.

*Provided frame csv files are also included for testing.
